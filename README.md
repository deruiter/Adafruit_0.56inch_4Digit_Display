# Adafruit 4 Digit 7 segment (clock) displays
Eagle CAD files for the excellent Adafruit 0.56" 4 Digit Display's

I absolutely *LOVE* the Adafruit 4 Digit 7 segment (clock) displays...
They come in different colors and are Common CATHODE so you can use them with the Maxim 7219 / 7221 chips

I use them a lot so I made a PCB for the display's, check it out...


The wunderful Maxim 7219/7221 chip is what I use to control the 7 segment displays, so the Ledcontrol library is added, also some information about the Maxim chip and Ledcontrol library.
